- Install libraries with `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
- first open the console then run the code with `py main.py`
- **NOTE:**  You need python 3 on your computer for this method
### second method / easy but I don't recommend
- download the latest version [here](https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/Valorant-External-Cheat/releases)
- run `r3nzthecodegod.exe`

## Game Settings
- **You have to play the game in `purple colorblind mode`**

## Ban Risk
- I don't know but it's too low. I have been using it myself for 2 weeks, I have not been banned.
## Keybinds
- trigger toggle `ctrl + alt`
- bunnyhop toggle `ctrl + space`
- `ctrl + tab` to switch mode
- `ctrl + down` to decrease `ctrl + up` to increase the trigger area
